        <h2>Old Physics Days...</h2>

        <h4 id="qcd-sum-rules">Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) Sum Rules</h4>
<p>QCD Sum Rules, a pivotal method in theoretical physics, was developed to bridge the gap between observable properties of composite particles, or hadrons, and the fundamental Quantum Chromodynamics theory. <br>This theory governs the strong interactions between quarks and gluons.</p>

<p>At the heart of this method lies the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and the concept of quark-hadron duality. <br>The OPE allows for the expression of the product of two quantum field operators as a sum over local operators. <br>This sum, which expands in powers of quark masses and the vacuum expectation values of the QCD operators (condensates), contributes to the theoretical side of the sum rules.</p>

<p>These rules have been used to shed light on various properties of hadrons, such as masses, decay constants, and form factors. <br>They remain an essential tool for probing the low-energy domain of QCD, where the strong coupling constant is substantial and standard methods fall short.</p>

        
        <h5>Investigation of the Coupling Constants of Mesons by Using QCD Sum Rules:</h5>
        <p>
            In this research, the coupling constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons are investigated in the framework of QCD Sum Rules at vacuum and at finite temperature. <br>Theoretical studies on hadronic behaviours at vacuum and at finite temperature and density have a crucial role to understand experimental results and to guide future experiments.

        <h4 id="electronic-structure-theory">Electronic Structure Theory in Organic Battery Electrode Design</h4>
<p>Electronic Structure Theory serves as a critical tool in the realm of organic battery electrode design. <br>It enables the exploration of electron properties in materials, which is pivotal in understanding their conductivity, reactivity, and structural stability.</p>

<p>Density Functional Theory (DFT), a common method used in these investigations, provides key insights into the electronic structure of many-body systems. <br>The advantage of DFT is that it focuses on electron density, making the computation easier and more effective for larger systems.</p>

<p>In designing organic battery electrodes, Electronic Structure Theory helps in screening potential materials, predicting their behavior in the battery, and suggesting structural modifications to improve their performance. <br>Organic materials offer the promise of sustainability, high energy density, and the versatility of organic compounds.</p>

<p>The complexity lies in understanding and optimizing the redox reactions these materials undergo and ensuring their stability under operating conditions. <br>Here, Electronic Structure Theory becomes invaluable, offering critical insights that aid in designing more efficient, safer, and more environmentally friendly batteries.</p>

        
        <p>
            My research focused on the design of organic radical battery electrodes using semiconductive polymer structures. <br>The electronic structures of various polymers were analyzed, with calculations contributing to the understanding of singly occupied molecular orbitals and the potential for polyacetylene to be used as a polymer backbone in organic radical polymers.
